### why get there now when you could get there later, <i>but faster</i>?

I have worked on this project for a couple of months, and have only now realized its been hindering me. I want to create other projects, but I am a <i>One project kind of guy</i>. 

So, for right now, I have decided to put this project on hold. Till I return, you may look at my carefully crafted spaghetti code for <i>inspiration</i>.
